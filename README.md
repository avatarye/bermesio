## What is Bermersio?
Bermeiso is a free and open-source all-in-one Blender production and development environment manager. It is specifically designed for Blender artists and developers.

Bermesio serves as a central hub for all your Blender addons, scripts, and local development resources. It allows artists to create custom Blender setups with addons, scripts, and user configurations that can be shared across multiple versions of Blender. It also helps developers manage their Blender virtual environments by providing support for local scripts, addons, and Python libraries under development and construct Python environments freely.

Bermesio has a modular design that allows users to manage and combine all Blender resources without the need for manual local file management. This solves a major pain point for artists and developers who work with multiple versions of Blender and Python environments.

Bermesio is a standalone GUI application developed with the Qt framework. The initial plan is to support Windows first, with eventual expansion to Linux and MacOS.
## Current Status
Bermesio is currently in early development stage. It is not ready for release yet. The current version is 0.1.0.
